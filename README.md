Datasets for SNA examples in the book *Researching Digital Media and Society* (Lindgren &amp; Eriksson Krutr√∂k, SAGE, 2024).

`starwars.csv` is based on the datasets for the original trilogy (*A New Hope*, 1977; *The Empire Strikes Back*, 1980; and *Return of the Jedi*, 1983), as provided by [Evelina Gabasova](https://github.com/evelinag/StarWars-social-network). The data used is the one with `interactions-allCharacters`, meaning that the links between characters are defined by the times the characters speak within the same scene. For two non-English speaking key characters (R2-D2 and Chewbacca) the are counted as speaking if they are mentioned within the scene.
